Revision 1:
-----------

* The S.Bus serial protocol was updated to support receivers in FASSTest mode.
* The S.Bus Status screen now displays the highest frame loss value logged (%) in addition to the real-time value (%).
* The S.Bus Failsafe flag will now trigger the Lost Model Alarm.
* Frame loss lower than 15% will no longer display a status message on the SAFE screen and prevent arming.
* Battery voltage is logged and displayed on the SAFE screen.
* Two new gimbal modes, LOCK and HOME, are controlled from a 3-way switch on channel 8. Home position is configurable.
* Added the "SL Mixing" parameter to the Stick Scaling screen. This adjusts the stick input sensitivity in all "SL Mixed" modes.
* SL mixing rate is now configurable. The old modes correspond to a value of 5 (LOW), 10 (MEDIUM) and 20 (HIGH).
* Flight mode replaced 'Self-level' on the SAFE screen and will indicate "ACRO", "SL MIXING" or "NORMAL SL".
* LED flashing in sync with the LVA (Low Voltage Alarm) beeps.
* LED will flash rapidly for a few seconds after arming if the Low Voltage Alarm value is set too low.
* No access to the Mixer Editor or the Show Motor Layout screen unless a motor layout is selected.
* The Lost Model Alarm will sound after 20 seconds (i.e. after the Auto Disarm countdown).
* ACC Trim values can be tuned remotely.
* The Confirmation dialogue now has a header ("CONFIRM") and is also more informative.
* A confirmation beep is produced when the AUX switch is moved to a new position.
* ESC throttle calibration is now a lot safer since it will require enabling through the KK2 menu before it can be accessed.
* Improved button handling on the main menu. Pushing button 4 (MENU) on the SAFE screen and holding it down for too long will no longer activate a menu item.
* Fixed a bug that prevented remote tuning of SL P-gain from working.
* Fixed a bug in the Number Editor (original firmware) that allowed setting a value to zero (CLR) when the lower limit was higher.
* Fixed a bug in the original firmware that kept the "Link Roll Pitch" flag from being updated until the user returned to the SAFE screen.
* Fixed a bug that affected SL P-gain when switching from mixed to normal SL mode. SL P-gain remained on its previous value instead of being reloaded.
* The status text on the SAFE screen will now read "Tuning Ail+Ele" if tuning aileron when linked with elevator.


Revision 2:
-----------

* M7 and M8 outputs are now controlled by using a 16 bit timer to make them (almost) jitter-free.
* The DualCopter layout was renamed "DualCopter II" and both servos were copied to M7/M8 (reduced jitter).
* The TriCopter layout was renamed "Tricopter II" and a second yaw servo was added to M7 (reduced jitter).
* Bug fixed: The "Tuning Aileron" text wasn't displayed on the SAFE screen when aileron and elevator was un-linked.
* Replaced the "Calibrating ESCs..." text with "ESC CALIBRATION" to make it less confusing.
* Selecting "ESC Calibration" from the main menu will now display a confirmation dialogue window.
* The tuning rate setting is now remembered.
* Removed the S.Bus Status screen.
* A 'Failsafe' condition is now cleared by visiting the KK2 menu.
* Added the digital channel (DG1 aka. channel 17) to the second Receiver Test screen.
* Frame loss will no longer display a status message on the SAFE screen and prevent arming.
* Increased the gimbal offset resolution (10x). The gimbal HOME position values now go from -1000 to 1000.
* PWM output resolution increased from 555 to 625 steps on M1 to M6 and from 555 to 2500 steps on M7 and M8.
* ESCs will now be quiet while browsing the KK2 menus. This feature can be switched on/off from the Mode Settings screen.
* The Channel 7 value will now remain zero on the Remote Tuning screen when SL Gain is selected.


Revision 3:
-----------

* RX channel 6 will now control gimbal pitch offset while channel 7 will control roll offset.
* RX channel 6 now controls pitch and channel 7 controls roll when remotely tuning ACC trims and gimbal gains.
* LVA beeps are now limited to 1/4 second.
* New motor layout: V-Tail Hunter
* The status text on the SAFE screen will now be highlighted (and flashing) when attention is needed.
* New status message: "Check throttle level" will be displayed when the throttle stick is above idle position (preventing arming).
* On the Receiver Test screen, the throttle text now says "Idle" when the throttle actually IS idle. This makes the lower throttle endpoint adjustment easier.
* The main menu was rearranged a bit so that the Remote Tuning item now is on top.
* A few minor GUI changes.
* Bug fixed: Negative gimbal gain values couldn't be tuned remotely (i.e. they were forced to zero).
* Improved the Lost Model Alarm feature. The delay is now reset every time the switch (channel 17/DG1) changes state.
* The Lost Model Alarm will now sound (instead of the "Arming beeps") if the throttle level is set to idle during a failsafe condition.


Revision 4:
-----------

* Channel mapping (configurable for all input channels).
* Flight timer (displayed on the SAFE screen) runs while armed and throttle is above idle.
* Arming is refused unless aileron and elevator channels are centred.
* New status message: "Check aileron level." will be displayed if the aileron channel is more than 2.5% off-center.
* New status message: "Check elevator level." will be displayed if the elevator channel is more than 2.5% off-center.
* New status message: "RX signal was lost!" will be displayed if the receiver for any reason has stopped outputting valid S.Bus data during flight.
* New status message: "Bad channel mapping" will be displayed if incorrect channel mapping values are detected.
* Gimbal offsets can be set from the Gimbal Settings screen. Parameters for Home position were moved to the second Gimbal Settings screen.
* On the Receiver Test screen the aileron, elevator, rudder, aux2 and aux3 texts now show "Center" when these channels are centred precisely.
* ESC calibration now has more on-screen (usage) information.
* When roll and pitch are linked only one set of PI parameters are displayed for "Ail+Ele".
* Removed code for "hidden" button (PREV) on the Show Motor Layout screen.
* Miscellaneous GUI changes and code optimizations.
* Bug fixed: The Receiver Test screen will now be updated also when serial communication has timed out.
* Bug fixed: Button held down during start-up will no longer trigger the menu.
* Bug fixed: Remote tuning parameters are now loaded from EEPROM when the Remote Tuning screen is accessed.

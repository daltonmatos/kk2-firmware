
Revision 1:
-----------

* Channel mapping is now configurable for 8 input channels (in all RX modes). This enables receivers with less than 8 channels to access AUX2, AUX3 and AUX4 features.
* Flight timer (displayed on the SAFE screen) runs while armed and throttle is above idle.
* Remote tuning is now available in Standard RX mode through the Quick Tuning feature. Mapping the AUX input to AUX2 is required for this to work.
* Standard RX signal handling improved. For slow booting receivers status texts like "No aileron input" will be displayed until valid RX signals are detected.
* In S.Bus mode a switch assigned to DG2 (aka. channel 18) can now control several functions (i.e. Stay armed/spin motors, set digital outputs and increase stick scaling).
	- The Stay Armed/Spin Motors feature keeps the motors spinning and prevents the controller from being disarmed during flight.
	- Digital outputs (i.e. Rudder and AUX) can be used to control LEDs or other devices, but using transistors/FETs is recommended even at low current loads.
	- Stick scaling for aileron and elevator can be increased by either 20, 30 or 50.
* Added the digital S.Bus channels (DG1 and DG2) to the second Receiver Test screen.
* S.Bus input was moved from the elevator to the throttle pin since this simplifies the S.Bus signal cable wiring on a KK2 Mini.
* On the Receiver Test screen the aileron, elevator, rudder, aux2 and aux3 texts now say "Center" when these channels are centred precisely.
* Satellite DSMX mode added (with support for binding borrowed from Steveis).
* Selected RX mode (Traditional RX, CPPM, S.Bus or Satellite) is now displayed on the Version Information screen instead of the SAFE screen.
* New status message: "RX signal was lost" will be displayed on the SAFE screen if an RX output failure occurred during flight. This will also trigger the Lost Model Alarm.
* Added a second screen to Gimbal Settings. The gimbal home position parameters are set from this new screen and they are now available even in Standard RX mode.
* ESC calibration now has more on-screen (usage) information.
* When roll and pitch are linked only one set of PI parameters are displayed for "Ail+Ele".
* Battery voltage reading optimized (shaving off almost 0.1 ms) as suggested by Steveis (Thanks).
* Code optimization (reduced code size).
* Removed code for "hidden" button (PREV) on the Show Motor Layout screen.
* Bug fixed: Button(s) held down during start-up will no longer trigger the menu or change user profile.
* Bug fixed: Failsafe beep issue corrected in S.Bus mode.
* Bug fixed: Start-up delay caused problems for satellite binding.
* Bug fixed: Status message priority corrected for "Satellite protocol error" and "No Satellite input".
* Bug fixed: Remote tuning parameters are now loaded from EEPROM when the Remote Tuning screen is accessed.


Revision 2:
-----------

* Motors and ESCs can easily be checked for correct wiring by running the new 'Check Motor Outputs' feature where the motors will run for one second sequentially.
* Stand-alone Gimbal Controller mode added. In this mode arming is disabled and the SAFE screen will be static (with less details) to avoid PWM output interruptions.
* Sub-menu 'Extra Features' was added to contain the two new features above.
* Sub-menu 'Advanced Settings' was added and a few menu items from the main menu were moved here (i.e. Channel Mapping, Sensor Settings and Mixer Editor).
* Serious RX signal problems will be logged to EEPROM and displayed when disarmed or after a reboot. Hold down button #4 during startup to change the log setting.
* A 'dead zone' can now be set for aileron, elevator and yaw input channels.
* Resetting user profile #1 will now also reset a few system parameters: Default User Profile, LCD Contrast and RX Mode. Restart will therefore be enforced.
* The beep that was produced every time the AUX switch changed position will now be skipped if the flight mode stays unchanged.
* Increased the timeout limit for CPPM, S.Bus and Satellite input signals to make the controller less sensitive to RX signal drop-outs.
* Code optimizations.
* Height dampening feature removed.
* Bug fixed: Beeps will now be produced for buttons pushed at the Trim Battery Voltage screen.
* Bug fixed: Gimbal mixing type wasn't loaded from EEPROM on the Gimbal Settings screen.
* Bug fixed: Satellite protocol detection prevented DSMX mode from working. Thanks to Helinor for helping out with debugging and testing.
* Bug fixed: Re-mapping the throttle channel in S.Bus mode resulted in bad input values.


Revision 3:
-----------

* Board orientation can be set to 0 (default), 90, 180 or 270 degrees. This setting is found on the 'Advanced' sub-menu.
* The Sensor Test screen has been improved and can also be used to check for correct orientation by tilting the controller board. Sensor value offset of 512 was removed.
* Added support for boards with reversed button order.
* The Reminder/Disclaimer message is now displayed when user profile #1 is reset since this dialogue is used for detection of reversed button order.
* Access to the 'Check Motor Outputs' feature is now refused when no motor layout has been loaded.
* The Quiet ESC feature is now affected by running the 'Import' and 'Reset' functions on the User Profile screen.
* Disabled pull-up resistor on the CPPM input pin. This might improve CPPM signal detection.
* Bug fixed: Servos no longer go to the endpoint when running the Check Motor Outputs feature.


Revision 4:
-----------

* A stick scaling offset can be assigned to each Aux switch position. You can add zero (default), 20, 30 or 50 to the normal aileron and elevator stick scaling values.
	- Selected stick scaling offset is displayed on the SAFE screen as "SS +20", 30 or 50. Alarm status is no longer displayed because of this.
	- In S.Bus mode you can no longer increase stick scaling values by using a switch assigned to DG2 (Channel 18).
* CPPM input was moved to the throttle input pin. This simplifies connection on the KK Mini board.
* Loss of CPPM sync is now detected and the ERROR LOG screen will display "CPPM sync was lost!" if this occurs while armed.
* KK2 LED will be flashing (one short flash per second) on logged error. This should be especially useful for the KK2 HC users.
* Added a delay (0.5 seconds) to the Motor Output Test sequence loop to give the active motor time to stop before the next one spins up.
* The Quiet ESC feature will always be active while browsing the KK2 menus. The configurable setting has been removed.
* In CPPM, S.Bus and Satellite mode the KK2 rudder pin is used as a Low Voltage Alarm output. A transistor is required to drive external devices like LEDs and buzzers.
* It is now possible to exit Stand-alone Gimbal mode without having to reset user profile #1.
* On the Sensor Test screen the "OK" and "Not OK" texts will no longer be displayed. Texts for ACC tilt directions will be displayed as before.
* The on-screen instructions for board orientation were changed to avoid confusion.
* Bug fixed: An incorrect battery offset value was shown when "Adjust Offset Value" was selected immediately after a firmware update (i.e. during the setup process).


Revision 5:
-----------

* RX serial data (for S.Bus and Satellite modes) can be viewed for debugging purposes. See the 'Extra Features' menu item.
* Selected battery alarm voltage (LVA setting) is now displayed on the SAFE screen, replacing the MPU temperature.
* Arming is refused unless aileron and elevator channels are centred.
* New status message: "Check aileron level." will be displayed if the aileron channel is more than 2.5% off-center.
* New status message: "Check elevator level." will be displayed if the elevator channel is more than 2.5% off-center.
* Miscellaneous GUI changes and code optimizations.
* Added default values for most parameters to the readme.txt file.
* Bug fixed: Non-existent channels could trigger a "Sat protocol error" message.
* Bug fixed: Uninitialized values could sometimes mess up the motor layout list on first use (i.e. immediately after a firmware upgrade).
* Bug fixed: Stand-alone gimbal mode had a problem with item selection on the Misc. Settings screen.
* Bug fixed: Digital output for LVA could get "stuck" when entering the menu in Stand-alone Gimbal Mode.


Revision 6:
-----------

* Alternative home screen with large font for improved readability on small screens.
* The Motor Spin feature can be activated from the Aux switch and is therefore available to all RX modes.
* 5-level TPA (Throttle PI Adjustment) with separate factors for P and I gains. See the 'Expert Settings' menu item.
* 5-level TSSA (Throttle Stick Scaling Adjustment). See the 'Expert Settings' menu item.
* An 'Expert Settings' sub-menu was added for the TPA and TSSA settings.
* The stick scaling offset that is set from the Aux switch will now also affect rudder.
* Gimbal code improved to allow a single servo gimbal (i.e. pitch on M8) to be used in combination with a tricopter's tail/yaw servo on M7.
* Battery voltage offset can now be specified for each user profile.
* Logged battery voltage will be reset when switching between user profiles that have different battery voltage offsets.
* New status message: "Motor Spin is active." will be displayed when the Motor Spin feature is active (arming is refused).
* Removed the SL Mixing parameter from the Stick Scaling screen. I recommend using the AUX switch stick scaling feature instead.
* Removed ACC SW filter code (imu.asm) and roll/pitch corrections are no longer skipped (also in imu.asm).
* Miscellaneous GUI changes and code optimizations.
* Bug fixed: Arming was allowed when the ERROR LOG screen was displayed.
* Bug fixed: Switching user profile was allowed when the ERROR LOG screen was active.
* Bug fixed: Negative battery voltages (caused by a negative offset) trigged the low voltage alarm.
* Bug fixed: No beep was produced when the user profile buttons were pressed (on the home screen).


Revision 7:
-----------

* All servo related settings can now be found on a new 'Servo Settings' screen.
* Servo limits/endpoints can be set for M7 and M8.
* Servo refresh rate can be set to 50, 57, 67, 80, 100, 133 or 200Hz in LOW rate mode. HIGH rate is still 400Hz.
* Servo oscillations can be eliminated/reduced by using a new filter parameter named 'Osc. Damping'.
* WS2812 RGB LED support with output on M6 or M7. The LED strip can have up to 25 RGB LEDs.
* The Motor Spin feature now has a 'Motor Spin Level' parameter that gives better control at low/zero throttle.
* 'Serial Link' RX mode was added to support my KK2.0 Port Expander firmware.
* Sensor reading (I2C) code rewritten with focus on speed. This part of the source code is also easier to follow/read.
* RX input synchronization code improved. This includes detection of wrong input signals.
* Serial RX input reading (i.e. S.Bus and Satellite data) improved.
* S.Bus HS (High Speed, 7ms) mode tested and confirmed to be working without problems.
* New motor layout: DualCopter Chinook. Mixer values supplied by CO2X. Thanks!
* When upgrading from revision 6 (R6) the disclaimer text will be displayed as a reminder. Restart will also be enforced.
* Removed debug screen for serial RX data.
* Miscellaneous GUI changes and code optimizations.
* Bug fixed: SL gain was not limited correctly. This bug appeared in revision 6.
* Bug fixed: The Battery Log screen will no longer be displayed after ESC calibration.
* Bug fixed: Repeated arming (i.e. when already armed) affected the PWM output. This bug stems from the original KK2.0 code.


Revision 8:
-----------

* 4 RGB LED patterns can be defined and accessed from any user profile.
* Brightness can be adjusted (+/- 100) for all active WS2812 RGB LEDs.
* The RGB LED strip is updated immediately after importing and resetting user profiles.
* Bug fixed: S.Bus sync problems caused annoying beeping on the SAFE screen (depending on the AUX switch position).
* Bug fixed: Satellite RX (re-)syncronization code didn't work as intended.
* Bug fixed: Low Voltage Alarm could produce beeps even when deactivated and with the battery monitor wire disconnected.

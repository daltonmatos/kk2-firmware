Revision 1:
-----------

* Battery voltage is logged and displayed on the SAFE screen.
* Customizable AUX switch functions (5 positions).
* Added the "SL Mixing" parameter to the Stick Scaling screen. This adjusts the stick input sensitivity in all "SL Mixed" modes.
* SL mixing rate is now configurable. The old modes correspond to a value of 5 (LOW), 10 (MEDIUM) and 20 (HIGH).
* Flight mode replaced 'Self-level' on the SAFE screen and will indicate "ACRO", "SL MIXING" or "NORMAL SL".
* LED flashing in sync with the LVA (Low Voltage Alarm) beeps.
* LED will flash rapidly for a few seconds after arming if the Low Voltage Alarm value is set too low.
* No access to the Mixer Editor or the Show Motor Layout screen unless a motor layout is selected.
* The Lost Model Alarm will sound after 20 seconds (i.e. after the Auto Disarm countdown).
* ACC Trim values can be tuned remotely.
* The Confirmation dialogue now has a header ("CONFIRM") and is also more informative.
* A confirmation beep is produced when the AUX switch is moved to a new position.
* ESC throttle calibration is now a lot safer since it will require enabling through the KK2 menu before it can be accessed.
* Improved button handling on the main menu. Pushing button 4 (MENU) on the SAFE screen and holding it down for too long will no longer activate a menu item.
* Fixed a bug that prevented remote tuning of SL P-gain from working.
* Fixed a bug in the Number Editor (original firmware) that allowed setting a value to zero (CLR) when the lower limit was higher.
* Fixed a bug in the original firmware that kept the "Link Roll Pitch" flag from being updated until the user returned to the SAFE screen.
* Fixed a bug that affected SL P-gain when switching from mixed to normal SL mode. SL P-gain remained on its previous value instead of being reloaded.
* Disabled all unused interrupts.
* The status text on the SAFE screen will now read "Tuning Ail+Ele" if tuning aileron when linked with elevator.


Revision 2:
-----------

* M7 and M8 outputs are now controlled by using a 16 bit timer to make them (almost) jitter-free.
* The DualCopter layout was renamed "DualCopter II" and both servos were copied to M7/M8 (reduced jitter).
* The TriCopter layout was renamed "Tricopter II" and a second yaw servo was added to M7 (reduced jitter).
* Corrected the status text message priority for "No Satellite input!" and "Sat protocol error!".
* Bug fixed: The "Tuning Aileron" text wasn't displayed on the SAFE screen when aileron and elevator was un-linked.
* Replaced the "Calibrating ESCs..." text with "ESC CALIBRATION" to make it less confusing.
* Selecting "ESC Calibration" from the main menu will now display a confirmation dialogue window.
* The tuning rate setting is now remembered.
* Increased the gimbal offset resolution (10x).
* PWM output resolution increased from 555 to 625 steps on M1 to M6 and from 555 to 2500 steps on M7 and M8.


Revision 2a:
------------

* Fixed a critical bug that made Remote Tuning too sensitive.
* The Channel 7 value will now remain zero on the Remote Tuning screen when SL Gain is selected.


Revision 3:
-----------

* Corrected a few factors and limits related to the PWM resolution change done in Revision 2.
* RX channel 6 will now control gimbal pitch offset while channel 7 will control roll offset.
* RX channel 6 now controls pitch and channel 7 controls roll when remotely tuning ACC trims and gimbal gains.
* ESCs will now be quiet while browsing the KK2 menus. This feature can be switched on/off from the Mode Settings screen.
* LVA beeps are now limited to 1/4 second.
* New motor layout: V-Tail Hunter
* Satellite binding problem fixed. Thanks to Steveis for solving this issue.
* The status text on the SAFE screen will now be highlighted (and flashing) when attention is needed.
* New status message: "Check throttle level" will be displayed when the throttle stick is above idle position (preventing arming).
* On the Receiver Test screen, the throttle text now says "Idle" when the throttle actually IS idle. This makes the lower throttle endpoint adjustment easier.
* SL Mixed mode is now activated when the (Lost Model) Alarm function is selected. Acro mode was used earlier.
* AUX switch functions are now set to 1:Acro, 2:Alarm, 3:SL Mix, 4:Alarm and 5:Normal SL after a Factory Reset.
* The main menu was rearranged a bit so that the Remote Tuning item now is on top.
* The Version Information screen now holds more technical information.
* Bug fixed: Negative gimbal gain values couldn't be tuned remotely (i.e. they were forced to zero).
* Bug fixed: LVA setting wasn't checked when re-arming the controller, preventing the LED from flashing if the voltage level was set too low.


Revision 4:
-----------

* DSMX support. This requires the DSMX firmware file to be loaded. Both versions have the exact same features and switching between them won't erase your settings.
* Channel mapping (configurable for all input channels) with support for AUX4 features (i.e. gimbal modes - LOCK and HOME).
* Added a second screen to Gimbal Settings. The gimbal Home position parameters are set from this new screen.
* Flight timer (displayed on the SAFE screen) runs while armed and throttle is above idle.
* New status message: "Bad channel mapping" will be displayed if incorrect channel mapping values are detected.
* New status message: "RX signal was lost" will be displayed on the SAFE screen if an RX output failure occurred during flight. This will also trigger the Lost Model Alarm.
* On the Receiver Test screen the aileron, elevator, rudder, aux2 and aux3 texts now say "Center" when these channels are centered precisely.
* Satellite protocol detection improved.
* ESC calibration now has more on-screen (usage) information.
* When roll and pitch are linked only one set of PI parameters are displayed for "Ail+Ele".
* The beep that was produced every time the AUX switch changed position will now be skipped if the flight mode stays unchanged.
* Removed the EEPROM initialization beep sequence (to free up some code space).
* Removed code for "hidden" button (PREV) on the Show Motor Layout screen.
* Miscellaneous GUI changes and code optimizations.
* Bug fixed: Start-up delay caused problems for satellite binding.
* Bug fixed: Status message priority corrected for "Satellite protocol error" and "No Satellite input".
* Bug fixed: The Receiver Test screen will now be updated also when serial communication has timed out.
* Bug fixed: Button held down during start-up will no longer trigger the menu.
* Bug fixed: Remote tuning parameters are now loaded from EEPROM when the Remote Tuning screen is accessed.

All ldz calls without a "*2", should use a ldz that does not consider offset
ack ldz | grep -v "*" | awk -F ':' '{print "sed -e \""$2"s/ldz/no_offset_ldz/\" -i", $1}' | bash -

All this should have "+offset" appended.
ack "\*2[\,\)]"  | grep "d[wb]"

Check if all "ldy <var> * 2" are calls preparing to use Z with LPM. If yes,
mustconsider offset.

For ldx, none of the uses make reference to "<var> * 2", so should be safe.
